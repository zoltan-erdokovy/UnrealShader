# UnrealShader

The UnrealShader for MODO 801 is a plugin which provides a physically
based material for creating assets for Unreal Engine 4. The new
surface properties are the same as in Unreal and MODO’s preview
render is a close approximation of the in-game look.

The latest kit is always in the following location: /Kit/UnrealShader.lpk
